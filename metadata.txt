description=Flags line segments shorter than a defined threshold.
about=VertexDistanceChecker is a QGIS plugin designed to detect unusually short segments between consecutive vertices in line geometries. These short segments often indicate oversampled geometry, digitization noise, or potential data quality issues.
 
 Users can define a minimum allowed segment length, and the plugin will flag all cases where the distance between two vertices falls below that threshold. Results are displayed in an interactive dock with zoom-to-feature functionality, and can optionally be exported as a point shapefile marking the midpoint of flagged segments.
 
 The plugin supports both full-layer checks and selected-feature-only analysis.
